Energy calibration and a dose rate computation algorithm for a FPG detector

The aim of the project was to recreate results published in a non-peer-reviewed article: Paolo Tancioni, Ulisse Gendotti, "Gamma dose rate monitoring using a Silicon Photomultiplier-based plastic scintillation detector", (https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03579). The article describes experimental method of measuring dose rate with a flat panel detector including its energy calibration. Measurements were performed using gamma-emitting radionuclide sources within 0.059 â€“ 1.333 MeV energy range. The main goal was to optimize parameters of the dose rate calibration function. Several approaches were considered within this project.
